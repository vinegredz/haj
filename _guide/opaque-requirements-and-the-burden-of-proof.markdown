**Opaque Requirements Lead to a Lack of Transparency in Consulates**

The Israeli consulate in Moscow lists this set of required documents that an applicant should bring in order to prove their Judaism. Compare this with the second, "unofficial list" below, which is never mentioned on the website or by phone.
​
Not only is the first list sometimes challenging to come up with, but to make matters worse, random items from the second list are demanded of applicants, who have to wait several months for a second appointment. Often, a third appointment is required when applicants  are asked for further items from the "unofficial list."

**The Official List:**
All passports in your possession
Birth certificate
Parents’ marriage certificate
Both parents’ birth certificates
Marriage certificates of your Jewish grandparents
Jewish grandparents’ birth certificates
Employment records
Military ID
Educational records
The Israeli IDs belonging to any of your Israeli relatives
The home addresses of your Israeli relatives
The telephone numbers of your Israeli relatives
Exact repatriation date of your Israeli relatives

“Documents must be presented in the original.”

**The Unofficial List:**

Passport photographs of applicants
Parents’ divorce certificates
Parents’ death certificates
Photographs of Jewish gravestones of parents
Parents’ employment records
Parents’ military records
Grandparents’ divorce certificates
Grandparents’ death certificates
Photographs of Jewish gravestones of grandparents
Grandparents’ employment records
Grandparents’ military records
Photographs of Jewish gravestones of great-grandparents
Certified Red Cross archive records of resettlement during WWII
Letters from Rabbis attesting to applicant’s involvement in community
Police reports attesting to applicant’s non-criminal background
Photographs of family members engaging in Jewish customs.

We help Jews find lost documents in official state archives, all the while demanding that the consulates stop being a barrier to Aliya from the former Soviet Union.
