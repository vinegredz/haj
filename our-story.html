        <h1 class="mb-4">When the System Fails Them, We Help the Jews</h1>
        <p>{{site.title}} is run by a group of legal professionals who specialize in the laws of Israeli repatriation.
            Anatoly
            Gakenberg and Eli Gervits have helped hundreds of former Soviet Jews exercise their legal and God-given
            rights to
            return home to Israel.</p>

        <p>We have seen the system fail many Post-Soviet Jews and shatter their dreams of making Aliyah. We started HELP
            A JEW
            to join forces and advance the coming of our shared destiny of the ingathering of the exiles and the end of
            injustice. Our programs aim to help individuals on a case-by-case basis and ultimately, bring lasting change
            to the
            system.

            <p class="lead text-primary pb-2 pt-3">“The Jewish people came out of the Holocaust proclaiming, “Never
                again! Never again! We are going to have our own land and our own state, and we are going to govern
                ourselves!”</p>

        </div>

        <br>

        <p>Our aim is to increase the number of Jews returning to the Holy Land until every last one of them can call
            Israel
            their home.</p>

        <p>The sad irony is that through its unjust and draconian practices, the Israeli government itself diminishes
            Jewish
            immigration to Israel. Consulates throughout the Soviet Union demand proof of Judaism in excruciating
            detail.
        </p>

        <p>This stands in stark contrast to the requirements for Western Jews, who simply need a letter from a
            Rabbi.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-light">Founder</p>
                </div>

                <div class="px-md-5">

                    <p>Anatoly Gakenberg was born in Russia. He graduated from Yaroslavl State University with LLB in
                        1996
                        and
                        made aliyah in the same year.</p>


                    <p>Three years later, he became a licensed Israeli attorney and started a law firm. Since he spoke
                        Russian,
                        the majority of Anatoly's clients were Russian Jews, recent immigrants from former Soviet
                        Union.</p>

                    <p>In 2006, Anatoly started his second law degree at the University of Kansas School of Law. After
                        graduating with a JD degree he was offered a senior position with major US law firm in Moscow
                        where
                        he
                        dealt with multi-million dollar acquisitions.</p>

                    <p>A few years after he realized that his true calling wasn't in corporate law, but in helping real
                        people
                        fight for justice.</p>

                    <p>Anatoly moved to London in 2010 where he focused on taking care of claims by Russian high net
                        worth
                        individuals relocating to the UK.</p>

                    <p>Throughout his legal career, Anatoly always stayed attuned to the needs of Russian Jews fighting
                        for
                        their way out of Russia to Israel and represented dozens of such clients.</p>

                    <p>Anatoly established this charity so that he could make lasting change in clearing the hurdles
                        that
                        Russian Jews face on their way to come home to Israel, like he once had, himself.</p>

                    <p>Anatoly is married and has a son, David, named after King David. He's a licensed attorney in
                        Russia,
                        Israel, Massachusetts, and England and Wales.</p>
